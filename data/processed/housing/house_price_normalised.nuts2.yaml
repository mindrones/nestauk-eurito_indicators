description: This indicator captures housing costs in a location. It takes the mean price of a house in a location and normalises it by the mean salary of its residents. Higher values represent lower house affordability for residents
title: Housing prices normalised by resident salaries
subtitle: Salary and Housing price data is available at the Local Authority District levels so we had to convert mean salaries (house prices) into volumes taking into account the number of people employed (transactions undertaken) in a location and aggregate at the NUTS level through a lookup table.
